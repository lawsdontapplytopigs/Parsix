# Parsix

#### An intuitive parser combinator library

### THE API IS UNSTABLE

Currently the library works and does the job, but the api is likely to change in the future.
So far I have implemented a json parser with this library. You can find it [here](https://github.com/lawsdontapplytopigs/Jsoff).

This library is an attempt at making writing parsers feel as intuitive and 
natural as I have found expressing views to be in elm with the [elm-ui]( https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui) library.
